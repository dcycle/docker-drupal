According to https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/manage-dependencies:

> For Drupal 11, use the composer template at [drupal/recommended-project](https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project). This template ensures Drupal Core dependencies are the exact same version as the official Drupal release.

* We are using . instead of web as an install directory
* We are not allowing profiles
* Allow plugins as per https://github.com/drupal/recommended-project/pull/17/files
